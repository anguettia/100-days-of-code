# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 5: September 18, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Built a game of tic-tac-toe using React.js. It was much simpler (and more fun!) than I expected.

### Day 4: September 8, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Did a refresher on React.js. It was a good opportunity to revisit the fundamentals and appreciate the capabilities of the framework.

### Day 3: September 6, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Learning more about Go. I found it interesting that slices are defined implicitly whereas maps are explicit. I wonder if these data types evolved at different times in the language's history?ðŸ¤”

### Day 3: September 3, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Picked up a tutorial on Go and learned the foundations of the language. My first impressions is that it borrows the simplicity of scripting languagues such as Python while keeping the traditional feel of C-languages.

### Day 2: July 26, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Practiced building a dynamic sliding ruler using Anime.JS

### Day 1: July 24, 2022

**Today's Progress**: I learned how to implement complex webpage animation using Anime.JS

**Thoughts:** I enjoyed discovering this library. I browsed a number of projects that showed the impact of a well-designed animation. I'm planning on spending the next few sessions exploring this library in more depth.

### Day 0: February 30, 2016 (Example 2)
##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts**: I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 1: June 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
